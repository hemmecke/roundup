Python compatiblity TODO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- the popen2 module is deprecated as of Python 2.6;
  the subprocess module is available since Python 2.4,
  thus a roundup.anypy.subprocess_ module is needed

- the MimeWriter module is deprecated as of Python 2.6.  The email package is
  available since Python 2.2, thus we should manage without a ...email_
  module;  however, it has suffered some API changes over the time
  (http://docs.python.org/library/email.html#package-history),
  so this is not sure.

  Here's an incomplete replacement table:

  MimeWriter usage                        checked for
  -> email usage                          Python ...
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~
  MimeWriter.MimeWriter
  -> email.Message.Message                (2.3)

  MimeWriter.MimeWrite.addheader
  -> email.Message.Message.add_header     (2.3)
